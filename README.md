## About the Project

![Project Screenshot](docs/img2.png)

The inspiration behind this project was to develop a robotic hand that dynamically adapts to the structure and movement of a human hand.  

This mismatch posed a core challenge:  
**How can we make a robotic hand accurately mimic a human hand when their joint structures are fundamentally different?**

Our solution involved developing a dynamic software system that controls a robotic arm with both revolute and prismatic joints.  
The system uses inverse kinematics (IK) and servo control to translate abstract hand poses into accurate physical movement ‚Äî  
without the need for recalibration or one-to-one joint mapping.


## Setup & Installation


1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orishlach/ik-servo-arm
   cd ik-servo-arm
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Connect Hardware (Optional)**

If you are using a Pololu Maestro:

- Connect the device to your computer.
- Set the correct port and baud rate in `main.py` (e.g., `COM3` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).

If no hardware is connected, the simulation will run without sending servo commands.

4. **Run the Application**

```bash
python main.py
```

5. **Usage**

- **Left Subplot**: Click to set a new IK target for the robotic arm.
- **Right Subplot**: Use sliders to adjust joint angles, prismatic extensions, and IK weights.
- The system automatically updates the simulation and optionally sends commands to connected servos.
